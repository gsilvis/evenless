The backstory is as follows: First there was sup.  sup is a thread-based email
indexer and client.  It's very fast (which I like), but it's written in Ruby
(which I don't).  So, in response to this came notmuch.  notmuch imitates the
back-end part of sup, but makes no effort to provide a front-end.  I want to
fill that place.

But, I don't want to read the many RFCs about email and MIME and such.  I want
this front-end to be PGP capable, but I don't to figure out how to do that.
Thankfully, there's a program that already does all of these things, and it is
mutt.

The concept of evenless, then, is that evenless provides a very slim front-end
to notmuch: You can search for threads, and do tagging operations on them.
But, if you want to do anything involving individual messages (like composing
or reading them), evenless hands that job off to mutt.

notmuch, to be sure, doesn't do much, given that xapian and offlineimap handle
most of what it does.  But I'm pretty sure this program does even less than
that. And thus was born 'evenless.'

-------------------

This is a very early release of evenless. So, you're on your own.  All I can
advise you is this: compile with

 gcc -o evenless evenless.c -lnotmuch

You'll need the 'notmuch' program, and libnotmuch (along with its header
files).  You'll also need mutt, and a way to send email from mutt.  I
recommend msmtp, but some people have had problems with it working with
less-than-RFC-compliant SMTP servers.  For notmuch to work, you'll need
offlineimap.  The configuration will be spread all over the place.

Have fun!
