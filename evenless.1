.TH EVENLESS 1 evenless\-0.0.3
.SH NAME
evenless \- front-end to the notmuch mail indexer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B evenless
[\fIOPTIONS\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR evenless
is a minimalistic frontend to the
.BR notmuch(1)
mail-indexing system. It lets you search for, tag, and untag threads. For all
actions involving individual messages (composing and reading), it invokes
.BR mutt(1)
with the appropriate arguments.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B [\-c/\-\-config] /path/to/config
Uses /path/to/config as the configuration file rather than the default
~/.evenless/evenless.conf
.TP
.B [\-d/\-\-database] /path/to/notmuch/database
Uses /path/to/notmuch/database as the database file, rather than reading a
config file to find it.
.TP
.B [\-s/\-\-search] query
Uses query as the search term rather than the default "tag:inbox". See
.BR notmuch(1)
for more details.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Prints the version and copyright, and then exits.
.SH USAGE
.TP
.B c/m
Compose a new message
.TP
.B q/x
Exit immediately.
.TP

Select a thread, then add a tag to it
.TP
.B T

.TP
.B A

.TP
.B v/Enter

.BR mutt(1)
.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.evenless/evenless.conf
This is the default configuration file for evenless, though it can be
overrided with the [-c/--config] option. As of right now this file has very
simple syntax: Lines beginning with '#' are comments. There must be exactly
one non-commented line, which specifies the full path to a notmuch database.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR notmuch(1)
.BR mutt(1)
.BR offlineimap(1)
.BR msmtp(1)
.SH LIMITATIONS
.BR evenless
does not have the capability of changing the tags of an individual message.
.BR evenless
also does not currently handle or even think about syncing notmuch tags to
Maildir flags. This will be fixed later.
