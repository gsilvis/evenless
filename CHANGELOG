	  Migrated to cmake (build systems, woo!)
          Added copyright notices to evenless.1 and CMakeLists.txt (Thank you, Liam!)
	Bug fixes:
	  Compiles w/out warnings
          Realized that it's not 2010 anymore, and that these files should probably say copyright 2011

          Added 'A' key to remove both 'inbox' and 'unread' tags

        Bug fixes:
          Fixed bug where selecting threads would sometimes fail [not fully understood yet]
          String input now strips trailing newline, fixing a bug where tagging would seem to fail
        New limitations realized:
          Syncing tags to maildir flags is not handled in any way currently.
